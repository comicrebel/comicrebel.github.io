<h1>Medieval and Modern Bischofszell, Canton Thurgau, Switzerland</h1>
<p>A Bronze Age Tumulus, scattered Roman and Alamanni items and Early Middle Ages documents provide evidence of earlier settlements. It was probably <strong>founded in the 9th Century</strong> by the Bishop of Constance Salomo I. The current town of Bischofszell is first mentioned in 1155 as Bischoffescella.[3] In 1250 it avoided being passed from the Bishop of Constance to the Prince-Abbot of St. Gall. In 1273 it was conquered the lords of Montfort, who burned the city. East of the castle a market and town grew up during the 13th Century. This new town around the market became the center of the modern city. The second enlargement began in 1360 when the noisy, smell or flammable businesses moved to the east of the town. Around 1405, this section was demolished for military reasons, and rebuilt, with a city wall, in 1437.</p>

<p>The town seal of 1338 (gloved arm with crozier) and the Charter of 1350 testify to the beginning of the municipal government. The financial difficulties of the Bishop encouraged the autonomy aspirations of citizens, who often bought city rights from the Bishop. Bischofszell remained mostly independent under the Bishops of Constance. Starting in 1276 the Bishop's Chief Bailiff resided in the castle. He was the chairman of the twelve-membered City Council. The bailiff, with two leading members of the council, formed the high court of the city between 1485 and 1798. The high and low courts were not identical. The City Court had the low justice rights in the city and surroundings, while after the conquest of Thurgau by the Swiss Confederation in 1460 the Governor had low justice rights in part of the city, and high justice rights over the Heiliggeistspitals.</p>

<p>After the Protestant Reformation, Z&#252;rich became the protector of the Protestant majority and attempted to protect them from the demands of the bishop. Complex political coalitions were created to govern Bischofszell. In 1587 a Confederation Vogt was appointed over the city, though the Prince Bishops retained power over the city until 1798.[3]</p>

<p>At the center of the old town, a city hall was built in 1626-29. The first city hall was destroyed in 1743 along with 70 other houses, in a fire. In 1747-50 a new city hall was built by Johann Caspar Bagnato (renovated in 1977-80). The entire population lived inside the city wall from 1437 until the 18th Century. In 1544-45 the cemetery was moved outside the walls.[3]</p>

<p>The castle was damaged by the city fire in 1419 and repaired soon thereafter. During the 17th and 18th Century the castle was expanded and totally renovated. The newly founded Canton of Thurgau took over the castle in 1798, but sold it in 1811 again. About 1838 the west part collapsed, and in 1843 the keep was broken up. Since 1930, the castle has been owned by the municipality.</p>

<p>The village church originally belonged to the Sulgen parish. It became an independent parish in 1269. During the 14th Century, the newly built St. Pelagius's Church (oldest foundations were from the 9th century) was a collegiate and parish church. Under Z&#252;rich's influence most of the population converted to the Reformation in 1529, but by 1535 the Catholic Mass was again celebrated in the church. In 1536 and 1563 the parish funds were shared between the two faiths. Starting in 1728 all city offices were evenly split between Catholic and Protestant individuals. occupied by an even equally. The two parishes included Hauptwil, Gottshaus and Halden as well as parts of Hohentannen and Schweizersholz. Until the construction of the Reformed St. John's Church in 1968, the old church was a shared church.[3]</p>

<p>In 1530 a Protestant school was established. The Catholic School was closed in 1536 and reopened in 1660 with support from the Bishops, though since the late 18th Century it was increasingly supported by the city. In 1834 a secondary school opened in the town and in 1870 both religious school districts united.</p>

<p>The wooden bridge on Thur (1300) and Sitter Rivers (from 1428) were replaced by stone in 1500. Because these bridges were exempt from taxes until 1796, Bischofszell became and important stop in the transshipment of textiles in the 15th-16th Centuries. It was quite successful in competition with St. Gallen and the Lake Constance towns. In the 17th and 18th Centuries the trading families of Rietmann, Bridler, Daller and Zwinger grew into powerful trading houses. The local textile production was, however probably of lesser importance. Crafts and trades protected their interests with restrictive decrees including the Gewerbeordnung of 1699 which prohibited guilds.[3]</p>

<p>Just as under the Ancien R&#233;gime, Bischofszell remained one of the richest municipalities during the Helvetic Republic. In 1812 the court of Engishalden and the hamlets of Winklen, Moosburg, Muggensturm, Klausenh&#228;usli, Katzensteig and Im Stich were allocated to Bischofszell. The town spend approximately one third of their assets on the construction of the railway line from Sulgen to Gossau. Its opening in 1876 may have been crucial in addition to the water for industrial expansion.</p>

<p>The first printer in Bischofszell the Thurgauer Druckerei founded in 1792 by Andrew Wehrli. From 1860 until 1872 they published the Bischofszell Zeitung and in 1870 published the Massschneiderei Munz. Between 1856-1911 the Jacquard weaving Niederer factory was active Bischofszell. Out of the Niederer factory, the paper mill (Papieri Bischofszell) grew and remained open until 1984. About 200 factory jobs offered in 1910 by two embroidery factories. The preferred industrial location in the 19th Century, was around the bridges. In the 20th Century the industrial park Bischofszell-Nord/Sittertal has drawn a number of companies. They include the cooperative Obi (1906) and Tobler (1909) canning factory, which since 1945 belongs to Migros. In the 1990s it employed about 700 employees and contributed to a positive commuting balance.[3]</p>

<p>Immigration changed the confessional (61% Reformed in 1870, in 1910 it was 55% and in 1990 only 40%) and political conditions, in the elections of the 20th Century, the Christian Democrats or CVP (or their predecessors) and the FDP were about equally represented, followed by the SP.[3] However, in the 2007 federal election the most popular party was the SVP which received 39.53% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the CVP (19.02%), the SP (11.33%) and the FDP (10.8%). In the federal election, a total of 1,537 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.0%.[4]</p>

<p>The city water supply was built in 1893 and in 1903/08-59 it had its own gas production. In 1908 a storm water control system was built and a Sewage treatment plant was added in 1973, both of which improved the city's infrastructure. The city has expanded into the terrace area to the east, with the 1945-46 housing development that created "Obi-village", the detached houses on L&#228;ttehang and along the roads to Sitterdorf and Sulgen. After an exodus in the 1970s, population began to grow again in 1990.[3]</p>
